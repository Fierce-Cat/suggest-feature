One of the components of Suggest Feature is our **Roadmap Page**, designed to keep your users informed and engaged with your product's development journey.

#### **Roadmap Overview**

The Roadmap displays user posts organized by status, providing a clear visual of what's in the pipeline:

* **Planned**: Features and fixes that are scheduled for future development.
* **In Progress**: Items currently being worked on by your team.
* **Completed**: Projects that have been finished and implemented.

This transparent approach helps manage user expectations and fosters trust by showing that their feedback directly influences your product's evolution.

#### **Key Features**

* **Dynamic Status Updates**: Changing the status of a post automatically moves it to the corresponding column on the Roadmap, ensuring real-time accuracy.
* **User Notifications**: Users receive email updates when the status of their posts changes, keeping them engaged and informed about developments that matter to them.
* **Customization Options**: Tailor the Roadmap to your workflow with customizable statuses and columns. This flexibility allows you to align the tool with your team's processes.
* **Access Control**: Manage which boards and posts are visible to users. You can restrict access to certain features or internal projects as needed.
* **Enhanced Collaboration**: By giving users visibility into your development process, you encourage continued feedback and strengthen your community.
