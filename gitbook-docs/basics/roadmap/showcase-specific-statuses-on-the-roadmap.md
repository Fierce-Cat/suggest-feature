# Showcase Specific Statuses on the Roadmap

{% embed url="https://asssets-docs.suggestfeature.com/roadmap-select-statuses.mp4" %}

Customize which statuses are displayed on your Roadmap Page. Whether you want to keep certain development stages private or emphasize specific phases, you have full control over the statuses visible to users.

You can also reorder the way the roadmap status columns are visible.

**How to Use:**

1. Go to your **Roadmap Settings** in the admin dashboard.
2. Under **Select Statuses for roadmap page**, select the statuses you want to showcase.
3. Save your settings to update the Roadmap Page.

{% hint style="info" %}
Posts with statuses not selected will not appear on the Roadmap Page.
{% endhint %}
