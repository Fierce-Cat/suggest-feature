## Comments Section Overview

* **Admin Comments:** Admin comments are highlighted with a blue color and marked with an asterisk (\*) for easy identification. Admins have full control over the comments section, allowing them to edit, delete, modify, or add new comments.
* **User Comments:** Logged-in users can add comments to any post. Comments support attachments, allowing users to upload images, documents, or other files to provide further details or context.
* **Nested Replies:** Users can reply to existing comments, creating a thread of nested replies to facilitate detailed discussions.

This flexible commenting system ensures a clear, organized, and engaging platform for feedback and communication between users and admins.
