#### Managing Posts in Suggest Feature

Take complete control over the posts in your Suggest Feature boards! This guide will show you how to effectively manage posts to keep your feedback organized and relevant.

As an admin, you have the power to:

* Edit posts to refine content or clarify ideas.
* Delete posts when necessary.
* Report and handle spam efficiently.
* Merge duplicate posts to streamline feedback. (ðŸš€ Currently in beta and in our roadmap)
* Unmerge posts that were previously combined. (ðŸš€ Currently in beta and in our roadmap)
* Move posts between boards for better categorization. (ðŸš€ Currently in beta and in our roadmap)

**1. Editing a Post**

Need to tweak a post for clarity or to refine its content? As an admin, you can easily make these changes:

* Click on the **"Edit Post"** option from the admin view to modify the content. You can also attach images or other files to the post for more context or visual support.

**2. Deleting a Post**

Sometimes, a post may need to be permanently removed. To delete a post:

* Choose the **"Delete Post"** option from the post's menu.

**Important Considerations Before Deleting:**

* If you suspect spam or inappropriate content, mark the post as spam before deletion. This action not only removes the post but also prevents the user from posting in the future.
* Deleting a post also removes all associated comments, and this action is irreversible.
* Authors and voters will not be notified when a post is deleted. If you want to keep a record of the post, consider marking it as "Closed" instead. This way, similar future requests can see that the topic has already been reviewed.

**6. Reporting a Post as Spam**

If a post violates guidelines or appears to be spam, mark it as such:

* Select the **"Report as Spam"** option.

**What Happens When You Report a Post as Spam:**

* The post and all its comments are immediately deleted.
* This action is irreversible, and the original author is blocked from posting again.

By using these tools effectively, you can keep your Suggest Feature boards clean, focused, and filled with valuable feedback. If you have any questions or need further assistance, our team is just a chat away! ðŸ˜ƒ
