Learn how to collect and manage user feedback through posts in Suggest Feature.

**Overview**

A post in Suggest Feature represents a userâ€™s idea, suggestion, or report that your team might consider for development. Users can vote on posts and leave comments, and they will automatically receive email notifications as the status of the post changes.

There are several ways to create a new post in Suggest Feature:

**1. Creating a Post Manually in the Admin Panel**

As an admin, you can create a post directly from the Feedback tab in your Suggest Feature dashboard. Simply click the "**Add Post**" button to submit feedback, feature requests, or bug reports. You can select the board you want to add the post to.

* Only team members (users/admins) listed in your Suggest Feature team members page can create posts in this way.
* Admins also have the ability to submit posts or votes on behalf of other users. (ðŸš€ This feature is in beta and in our roadmap)

**2. Submitting Feedback via the Suggest Feature Public Page**

End-users can easily submit their feedback or suggestions by visiting your public Suggest Feature page (e.g., yourcompany.suggestfeature.com). All users with access to a specific board are allowed to create new posts.

**Note:** End-users can delete their own posts if there are no comments and no other votes on the post.
{% endhint %}

**3. Using Integrations with Other Tools - (ðŸš€ This is in beta and in our roadmap)**

Feedback can also be collected through various integrations. These integrations allow you to create posts directly from your customer support or sales platforms and automatically link the original conversation or contact in the voter list for easy reference.

Explore all the available integrations in your Suggest Feature settings.

**4. Leveraging the Suggest Feature API - (ðŸš€ This is in beta and in our roadmap)**

Our API provides powerful options for developers to create and manage posts programmatically, allowing you to fully customize and enhance your experience with Suggest Feature.

Visit the API documentation for more details on how to integrate Suggest Feature with your existing tools and workflows.

**5. Importing Feedback via CSV - (For now please contact us, ðŸš€ This is in beta and in our roadmap so that you can do it yourself)**

If you're migrating to Suggest Feature or need to bulk import feedback, you can use our CSV import functionality. This option is particularly helpful for teams transitioning from another tool or consolidating feedback from various sources.

### **Adding Attachments to Posts**

When creating a new post via the Suggest Feature portal or widget, users can attach multiple files to provide additional context or details. For more details, please go to [files and attachment faq](../../faq/attachments-and-image-file-uploads.md)
