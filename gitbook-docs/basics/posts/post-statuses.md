# Post statuses

{% embed url="https://asssets-docs.suggestfeature.com/change-post-status.mp4" %}

**Overview**

Post statuses provide transparency to your users by showing the current stage of a feature request or bug report in the development lifecycle. Each status reflects the progress and priority of a post.

The default statuses available are:

* **OPEN** — No status has been assigned yet.
* **UNDER REVIEW** — The post is being considered by the team.
* **PLANNED** — The team has scheduled work on this post.
* **IN PROGRESS** — Active work is underway on this post.
* **COMPLETE** — The work on this post has been finished.
* **CLOSED** — The post will not be addressed.

**Updating the Status of a Post**

To update a post's status, navigate to the post in the admin view:

1. Choose a new status from the dropdown menu.
2. It will automatically update the status.

All users who have voted on the post and have access to the board will receive an email notification, ensuring everyone stays informed about the progress. Something similar to the below image

When a post status is updated, it is reflected in the user-facing roadmap, visible on your Suggest Feature homepage. You can also customize which columns are displayed on the roadmap by adjusting the settings in the **Roadmap** section.
