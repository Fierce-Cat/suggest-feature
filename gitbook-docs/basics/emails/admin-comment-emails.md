## Admin Comment Emails

### What are Admin Comment Emails?

Admin Comment Emails are notifications sent to users when a team member or admin responds to a post they've engaged with. These emails foster communication between your team and your community.

### Email Recipients and Timing

* **Recipients:**
  * Users who have voted on the commented post
  * Team members and admins who have voted on the post
* **Trigger:**
  * When an admin or team member adds a public comment to a post

### Email Content

Each Admin Comment Email includes:

1. The admin's comment
2. A link to the full post and conversation
3. A reply option (redirects to the post page)

The email design aligns with your organization's branding for consistency.

### Key Features and Considerations

* **Targeted Communication:** Use these emails to clarify user feedback, pose follow-up questions, or share minor updates.
* **Reply Functionality:** The reply button directs users to the post page. Direct email replies are not added as comments to maintain conversation integrity.
* **Engagement Tool:** These emails keep your community involved and informed about feature progress.

### Best Practices for Admin Comments

1. **Progress Updates:** Share development milestones, timeline changes, or preview screenshots to build excitement.
2. **Feedback Gathering:** Ask specific users for more details about their needs or potential solutions.
3. **Clear Communication:** Keep responses concise and easy to understand.
4. **Tone Setting:** Maintain a friendly yet professional tone to foster positive interactions.
5. **Discussion Encouragement:** Invite further input to keep the conversation flowing.

### Maximizing the Impact of Admin Comment Emails

* Use these emails to demonstrate active listening and responsiveness to user feedback.
* Leverage them as a tool for community building and user engagement.
* Regularly review and refine your commenting strategy based on user responses and engagement metrics.

Admin Comment Emails are a valuable feature for maintaining an open dialogue with your user base, ensuring they feel heard and involved in your product's evolution.
