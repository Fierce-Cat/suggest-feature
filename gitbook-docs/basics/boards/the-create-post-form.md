**Overview**

The **Create Post** form is where users will submit new feedback, such as feature requests, bug reports, or suggestions. You can customize the form's fields and wording to ensure it is optimized for the type of feedback you want to gather.

Each board in Suggest Feature‚Äîlike the **Features Board**, **Bug Board**, etc.‚Äîhas its own dedicated **Create Post** form. This allows you to tailor each form to the specific context and needs of that board, ensuring the feedback is relevant and actionable.

You can customize every text string in the form to suit your needs. This flexibility allows you to match the language and tone of the form to your brand or audience.

**Customization Options**

* **Edit Field Labels and Descriptions:** You can change the labels and descriptions for each field to make it clear what type of information you need from your users.
