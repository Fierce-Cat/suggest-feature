# Reordering Boards

{% embed url="https://asssets-docs.suggestfeature.com/reorder-board.mp4" %}

If you have multiple boards in Suggest Feature, you can easily change their order to prioritize certain categories or topics. Follow these steps to reorder your boards:

1. Go to the **Boards** section.
2. Click and hold the **drag handle** (represented by a three-line icon or dots) next to the board you want to move.
3. Drag the board up or down to your desired position in the list.
4. Release the board once it is in the correct position.
5. Click on **Save Order** once you are done with the ordering.

Reordering boards can help you better organize user feedback and make sure the most relevant or active boards are easier to find for your users.
