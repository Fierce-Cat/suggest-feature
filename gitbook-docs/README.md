## Our Philosophy: Open Source at the Core

Your data belongs to you‚Äîno one else. While platforms may change, your data should remain yours, always. You should have the freedom to switch providers seamlessly through simple import and export options. The power to control your data should be in your hands, and the code that runs your platform should be open source, benefiting everyone.
