### What is GDPR?

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law that strengthens and unifies data protection for all individuals within the European Union (EU). The regulation gives individuals more control over their personal data and imposes strict rules on organizations regarding data processing, storage, and sharing.

* **Transparency**: You have full visibility into what data is collected, how it is processed, and for what purposes.
* **Data Ownership**: Your data is yours. You have the right to access, modify, export, or delete your data at any time.
* **Lawful Data Processing**: We process your data only when you have given explicit consent or when it’s necessary for legitimate business interests, always in compliance with GDPR.
* **Data Minimization**: We collect only the data that is essential to provide our services and do not retain unnecessary information.
* **Security**: We implement robust security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, breaches, or misuse.

### Privacy Principles
