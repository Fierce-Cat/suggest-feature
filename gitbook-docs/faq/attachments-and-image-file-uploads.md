If you try to upload a file type that is not listed above, you will receive an error message. Please convert the file to a supported format before uploading.

### Number of Files

You can upload multiple files at once, up to a maximum of 50 files per upload. If you attempt to upload more than 50 files at a time, you will receive an error message. Please divide your files into smaller batches and try again.

### Image Size and Resolution Requirements

To maintain the quality and performance of our platform, please adhere to the following image size and resolution guidelines:

* **Maximum file size:** 10 MB per image
* **Maximum resolution:** 5000 x 5000 pixels

Images exceeding these limits may be compressed or rejected. For the best results, we recommend uploading images with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels or smaller.

### Document and Video Size Requirements

For documents and videos, the maximum file size allowed is 10 MB per file. If your file exceeds this limit, consider compressing it or breaking it into multiple smaller files or you can always post a link to a file sharing service containing your file.

### Best Practices for Uploading

* **File Names:** Use descriptive and concise names for your files, avoiding special characters.
* **Image Quality:** Ensure that your images are clear and high-quality for better understanding.
* **Document Clarity:** Make sure documents are well-formatted and easy to read.
* **Video Quality:** Ensure videos are compressed to the optimal size while retaining good quality.

### Common Errors and How to Avoid Them

* **File Size Too Large:** Compress your files or reduce their resolution to meet our size requirements.
* **Unsupported File Type:** Convert your file to a supported type before uploading.
* **Slow Uploads:** Ensure you have a stable internet connection, and try uploading during non-peak hours.
* **Too Many Files:** Split your upload into batches of 50 files or fewer.
