## White Label Services

Enhance your brand presence with Suggest Feature's white label capabilities. Our white label service allows you to use your own domain for sending emails and implement other custom configurations, providing a seamless experience for your users.

### Email Sending

#### Using Your Domain

We offer the ability to send emails from your own domain, maintaining brand consistency in all communications with your users. This means that instead of emails coming from a Suggest Feature address, they'll come directly from your company's email domain.

#### Email Service Provider

* We primarily use Amazon SES (Simple Email Service) for sending emails.
* We also support integration with other custom email providers to suit your specific needs.

### Additional Custom Configurations

Beyond email sending, we can work with you to implement other custom configurations that align with your brand and workflow requirements.

3. **Implementation**: We'll guide you through the process of setting up your domain for email sending and implementing any other custom configurations.
4. **Testing**: Before going live, we'll conduct thorough testing to ensure everything is working as expected.
5. **Go Live**: Once testing is complete and you're satisfied, we'll activate your white label services.

### Benefits of White Labeling
