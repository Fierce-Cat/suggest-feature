# Why Authenticate Users for Feedback?

At Suggest Feature, we believe that knowing who's behind each piece of feedback is crucial for making informed product decisions.

### Benefits of Authenticated Feedback

When users provide their identity before submitting feedback through Suggest Feature, you gain several advantages:

1. **Targeted Insights**: Identify which users are requesting specific features, allowing you to prioritize development based on your most valuable customers.
2. **Effective Communication**: Easily follow up with users to:
   * Clarify their suggestions
   * Understand their use cases
   * Keep them informed about feature development progress
3. **Relationship Building**: Foster a community of engaged users by maintaining an ongoing dialogue about their ideas and your product's evolution.

### Seamless Authentication with SSO

We understand the importance of a frictionless user experience. That's why Suggest Feature offers [Single Sign-On (SSO) integration](../advanced/single-sign-on-sso-custom-authentication/). Users who already have an account in your system can easily authenticate without creating a new account, ensuring a smooth feedback submission process.

### The Power of Identified Feedback

Anonymous feedback can be a black box, but identified feedback gives you the full picture. Our platform connects each piece of feedback to a real user with real needs, ensuring that your product decisions are always aligned with your users' expectations.

### How We're Different

Unlike platforms that treat feedback as isolated data points, Suggest Feature creates an ecosystem where every suggestion is tied to a user identity. This approach transforms how you gather and act on user feedback, turning it into a strategic asset for your product development.

Ready to revolutionize your feedback process? Let Suggest Feature show you the power of authenticated user insights.
