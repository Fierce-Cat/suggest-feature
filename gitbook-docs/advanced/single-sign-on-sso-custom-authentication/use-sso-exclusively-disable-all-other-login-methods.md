# Use SSO Exclusively (Disable All Other Login Methods)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When enabled, this option enforces SSO as the only valid login method for end users. All other authentication methods (social logins, email/password) are disabled. Only users authenticated through your configured SSO system can access Suggest Feature. This enhances security and simplifies user management by centralizing authentication through your organization's SSO provider. Ensure your SSO system is properly configured before enabling this option, and communicate this change to all users as it will impact their login process.
